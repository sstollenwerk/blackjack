Intention is to make a blackjack simulator as a training exercise in python.

Goal is to first write the game as a cli, then as a gui (likely via pygame)
Intention is to write the game in such a way that can have gui interface with minimal changes to the actual game.



rules used:

blackjack has multiple variants, am aiming to roughly implement ones at
https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
with possible exception of splitting pairs because that seems difficult.

I will of course ignore rules about whether the player holds cards or how each move is signalled because those feel meatspace only.
